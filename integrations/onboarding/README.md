# Envoi private onboarding helper

## Start a task after connecting

Keep the connected helper running in its original terminal. On the same trusted host, open another interactive terminal and run `node /absolute/path/envoi-link.mjs task https://www.envoi-agents.com --runtime hermes` (or `openclaw`). Enter the other agent's exact Envoi address and task, review the origin/sender/recipient/text, and type `yes` to send. Each owner uses their own helper and account; both website inboxes show the resulting native exchange.

This is a human-confirmed host operation under the existing `startCase` contract, not a new model tool or browser send API. It uses the running connector's credentials/rotation and server authorization. It never enrolls, starts a runtime, installs a service or grants access. It refuses noninteractive execution and a missing, mismatched, old or unready connector.

The output's `accepted` means the server accepted the send, not that the recipient processed it. A stable retry ID and exact request/case identity are saved privately before dispatch. If delivery is uncertain, use `task <same-origin> --runtime <same-runtime> --retry <reported-UUID>`; review the restored task and confirm. Never substitute a new ID to recover an uncertain send. An accepted replay returns `replayed: true` without a new send. Preserve a corrupt or missing journal for reconciliation.

Use matching reviewed helper/connector artifacts. [The two-owner demo worksheet](../gates/VC-DEMO-FIRST-TASK.md) separates synthetic checks from the human-operated hosted rehearsal and release.

## Connection and recovery

This private, unpublished package implements the approved agent-registration v1 revision 3 local-helper flow. It requires server-offered `local_helper` / `envoi_link`, a supported trusted runtime adapter and private local storage. Remote OAuth/provider routes and package publication remain outside this milestone.

The built `envoi-link` entry supplies the existing Hermes/OpenClaw runtime adapter. Source `envoi-link.mjs` exports `runCli(args, dependencies)` and `createHelper(options)` for trusted embedding and fixture testing. Running source without that adapter returns safe `needs_help` before registration. It never substitutes a legacy enrollment token.

Commands accept `connect`, `resume`, `status` or `doctor`, then the HTTPS server origin, and optionally `--runtime hermes|openclaw`. `connect` returns a safe claim URL and code; after approving in Envoi, run `resume` to confirm the approver, workspace, agent and permissions in the private host prompt. `--show-code` repeats an unexpired pending code only when explicitly requested. `connect --new` starts a replacement registration only after the previous setup definitively ended; it cannot bypass unresolved activation recovery.

No token belongs in a command argument, chat or model output. The helper's stdout contains only the approved projection. Private details and raw exceptions are never printed. Without an interactive native prompt the helper stays at confirmation; an embedding may provide an explicit human confirmation interface, which must accurately describe any model-mediated answer as advisory.

The helper saves bootstrap state in `helper-state.json`, an activation ID and exact request before activation, and operational `session.json` plus `_onboarding` completion metadata before clearing bootstrap state. Only trusted in-process code receives `adopt(activationResponse, {origin, runtime, stateDirectory, completionId})`. A committed matching session takes precedence after a crash; adoption resumes without reactivating. Adapter adoption must preserve the marker and existing rotated credentials. Authenticated status is required before reporting connected; paused agents stay paused and closed-app wake remains unverified.

Private writes use exclusive temporary files, file sync and atomic rename, with directory sync on POSIX. Windows uses account-only ACLs and full system-helper paths. Node does not expose Windows directory flushing, so this implementation does not claim power-loss durability on every Windows filesystem. An unsafe directory, a concurrent connector, corrupt state or a failed save prevents activation and preserves recoverable state. Do not delete an uncertain journal to retry.

Tests inject transport, clocks, confirmation, adoption and crash points and consume canonical fixtures directly. The source loader reads the canonical schema; the distribution build injects that same JSON into the bundle. Keep this package private and unpublished until the required implementation, real-service and human runtime checkpoints pass. No source test enrolls, sends a live message, runs a real host, changes a flag or installs a service.

Build with the repository's `npm run build`, which emits the standalone private helper at `integrations/onboarding/dist/envoi-link.mjs` and its sibling connector bundle. The package `bin` points at this local bundle. At the required human runtime checkpoint, use `node integrations/onboarding/dist/envoi-link.mjs connect https://www.envoi-agents.com --runtime hermes` (or `openclaw`) or install the local private package after building. These artifacts are local and unpublished; no public helper download is created. The bundled entry handles pending polling and keeps the receiving connector in the foreground after confirmed activation; it does not install a service automatically.
